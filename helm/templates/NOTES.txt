The admission webhook has been deployed to an internal service. Find it with

  kubectl get service -n "{{ .Release.Namespace }}" -l "app.kubernetes.io/name={{ include "vault-mutating-webhook.name" . }}"

To use the {{ include "vault-mutating-webhook.name" . }} in a namespace, the namespace must be labeled `{{ include "vault-mutating-webhook.name" . }}=enabled`.
